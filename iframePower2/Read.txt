what did you do, why and how long for each part (constraints, decisions, planning)
-At first I did a litle research about similar projects
-Identified inputs, outputs, constraints and process in my mind
-Divided the work three part, 1-first API 2-Second API, 3-Favorite functionality
-Started through creating a basic HTML structure
-After then focuced JS part
-Last design by using CSS

why this tech stack?
-HTML,CSS,JS
because for now I know only these ones 

what is the status at the end?
-the app works with second API properly but there are a few issue with first one
-favorite functionality is not available yet

assumptions you made / questions you clarified project enhancements you did
sketches you made (if you made them)
note areas of improvement
